# Software Requirements
To view and run the attached jupyter notebook, you will need the following software:

Python 3 with the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- requests
- plotly
- jupyter 

I recommend using the anaconda python distribution, that comes bundled with jupyter, numpy,
pandas, and requests. 

Plotly will need to be installed using: 

pip install plotly

The same command (pip install 'package name') can be used for installing the other packages
if you do not have them. 


# Running the notebook
In the directory with the .ipynb file, run the following command from the terminal:

jupyter notebook Title_of_Project.ipynb 

This should open a browser window, displaying the ipython notebook for the user. 
To execute the code cell by cell, press shift + enter for each of the cells. Alternatively,
you can run all of the commands using the toolbar at the top and select "Cell", then select
"Run All". 

After executing all of the code cells, you can then begin to query each database and 
generate a plot comparing the mutation information in each database. 

As you will see, I have already executed two examples, one using the gene "HRAS", and a 
second example using "BRCA1" (a well-known breast cancer gene) - the id must be a valid HUGO 
gene_symbol. 

There is an additional static html file that you can view of the notebook.
